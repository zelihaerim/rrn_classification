stuff novels nightmares thought rotj clearly best three star wars movies find surprising rotj considered weakest installment trilogy many voted seemed like rotj best profound plot suspense surprises emotionalespecially ending definitely episodic movie personally like empire strikes back lot also think slightly less good rotj since slowermoving episodic feel much suspense emotion third movieit also seems like reading surprising reviews reasons people cited rotj inferior film two plain ludicrous insignificant reasons compared sheer excellence film whole heard many strange reasons yoda died b bobba fett died c small ewoks defeated band stormtroopers darth vader revealedi would like debunk reasons believe miss point completely first cares bobba fett died george lucas wanted die wanted die dont get wrong fan bobba fett made cameo appearances lucas intention make central character films star wars fans made name even mentioned anywhere movie go credits find bobba fetts name judging rotj minor character died bit much think secondly many fans like yoda dying sure momentous period movie happy see die either makes movie realistic good guys cant stay alive realistic movie know otherwise good guys lived bad guys died movie would tantamount cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect point people liking yodas death well nobody complained darth vader struck obi wan kenobi new hope many consider new hope best trilogy obi wans death okay yodas hmmmmmmmmmmmm another reason believe even stated people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers impossible utterly ridiculous believe one first ewoks native planet endor cognizant home terrain since live watch movie carefully many tactics ewoks used defeating stormtroopers excellent use home field advantage since lived forest life hope would learned use advantage swinging vines ropes logs set trip walkers traps stormtroopers highly disadvantaged outnumbered aware advantages forest thing blasters add like ewoks battling stormtroopers heavily assisted band rebels conquest thought stormtroopers defeated combination star wars heros band rebels well huge clan ewoks great familiarity home terrain would great upset lastly scene still unbelievable empire strikes back new hope several scenes group consisting han solo chewbacca princess shot like ten stormtroopers blasters missed heros full view heroes course always hit stormtroopers blasters troopers must bad aim least empire strikes back battle endor much believable since two armies pitted heroes legion stormtroopers dont believe check battle cloud city heroes escaping landos base heros rescuing princess leia shot somehow missedas han solo luke trying exit death starthe last reason care discuss others plain ridiculous spend time people like darth vader revealed well many ways major part plot movie luke trying find whether darth vader father annakin skywalker would disappointing movie ended without luke getting see fathers face made complete annakins revelation symbolized transition darth vader underwent possessed dark side helmet good person annakin skywalker removing helmet point annakin died converted light side meaning helmet removal scene fact thats would done scene lukes fatherisnt would done wanted see son eyes died mechanized helmeton another note think subconscious conscious expectation among people sequel must worse even better preceding movies another reason rotj get many accolades deserves never go film deception mind always try go film attitude well might better worse original know sure lets see way go open mind dupe thinking clearly superior film good really wasi sure criticizes movies asked many college students adults favorite star wars movie tell except one person said new hope favorite rotj believe results polls appalling quite misleadingbottom line return jedi best trilogy movie one three kept riveted throughout minutes moment boredom scene either suspenseful exciting surprising example emotional light saber battle luke father rotj better one empire strikes back dayfinally hope people go see phantom menace open mind fans start looking nitpicky insignificant details see another sequel trash movie movie stinks luke meritorious film become another spectacular movie subject derision like rotj suffered unfortunately crossfire remains one best hollywood message movies unlike admirably intentioned

characters movie even start care interested themthe way story told isnt however best hard keep track story times jumps one sequence location movie isnt always logic storytelling features bit many

taking film like crossfire puts another film spreads around social consciousness ie recent film crash almost shame necessarily either one puts forth message intoleranceisrotten significantly although id wager crash throws hammer much thickly comparison storytelling contrivances never get much way like crash maybe really necessary compare two crossfire core deep filmnoir vein like going style interesting actually see director edward dmytryk said dvd interview mentioned budget photography significantly lower purpose could spent actors schedule went brisk quick pace comes incredible picture would think looking many lighting setups took lot small scene like robert mitchums keeely first goes questioning captain robert young contrasts shadows seamlessly room exquisite many lighting setups go even little marks something essential realm look noir period take look shot characters stairwell bars silhouetted see meanbut back substance part film really story consists murder mystery one audience dont take long figure answer something else mind soul killer wouldnt found common crime picture really criminals part film theres calculated risk characters could thin prop worthwhile message antisemitism dmytryks direction topshelf cast along really terrific script john paxton fleshes characters least seem thin alongside message would noir without attitude go along mitchum helps along even scenes like young much based situation storys moment ie detail plot injecting little sly wit dialog may already lines helps make character good edge scenesthen theres also robert ryan excels montgomery man know dont like much first bs demeanor youre totally sure either starts come clearer ironically subjective viewpoint suspect mitchell george cooper apartment soontobedeceased samuels performance becomes great balancing act full crap also rather frightening blindway good performance also countered cooper actual personal issues faces comes forward regret humility really film ends one thinks lot however youre watching film getting dialog flow scenes sometimes stark overpowering camera moves actors message way secondary isnt important one especially time period coming right ww years later seeing actors even ones dont get big marquee status like gloria grahame ginny femme fatale picture couldve time one doesnt william phipps leroy hick working one another sticks much

beginning develops course film ruthless despot history records ruthless despot part sympathetic beginning leaves room real character development course long film famous story meeting assassin true two thousand year old anecdote gong li lovely emotional core story makes great movie making westerner watching another cultures view tradition marriag found married mesmerizing delightful idea marrying stranger mutual arrangement parents difficult especially modern age yet case hindi film told humor fresh perspective learn abhay ritika met traditional five day honeymoon said difficult believe cell phone affluent age archaic custom arranged marriage still take place see awkwardness young couple feels come together first night try forge bond even though know one another see different views marriage commitment presented couples also holiday couple forty years married others still unsure making marital commitment theres song witty dialog poignant moments blending comparison new ways tradition watching movie subtitles definitely loses trueness story yet still delight watch granted plot little trite bus incident bit drawn contrived however overall movie worth watching interesting movie think humorous although humor black fulci good funny acting really funny truly crazy selfportrait artist make horror films would make love films noone would buy tickets really sexy movie also almost time action tension going many sexy girlswomen maybe goes core anyone starts moviesart first place real psychedelic trip maybe best seen little drunk similar state mind really nasty gore scenes also course lucio fulci matter fact scenes quite disgusting anyway one three best complete fulci films ive seen others house cemetery zombihavent seen beyond actually script overally opinion quite ingenious could see movie portrait extreme neurotic person suffers obsessivecompulsive disorder fashionable words character compulsive need confess crimes bad thoughts especially crimes hasnt even done questions time done want done want overreacts exaggerates thoughts im sure fulci interested psychology maybe even read something area house cemeterymovie example character named freudstein maybe concentrated straightly personal movie fulci also like simplicity photographypictures film thing disturbs little bit sadism especially towards women dont quite understand entertainment art horror anyways overall really interesting well made movie definitely recommended classic film least fans anyone interested genre others may much hadnt planned seeing movie however wasnt disappointed friend dragged along although real surprises guys reasonably well obviously modest budgetif youve seen trailer probably know expect type movie theres pretty constant stream jokes couple classic moments highpoint probably excellent flashback guys like also ive read elsewhere ending disappointment found refreshingly different expected genreoverall movie wont change life got enough laughs keep entertained throughout although first glance movie looks like story parents high school life many people try tell movie way outdated admit first impression honestlythe lessons learned heroesheroines def outdated doesnt want famous doesnt want accepted peers homosexual guyisnt whole controversy today gay marriage blah blah movie though released still addresses biggest issues todays world movie little much profanity nudity taste though thus rating many films would describe perfect rififi definitely fits bill heist film come close plot simple engrosses never ceases amaze absolutely gripping film every time view care characters even though bank robbers presented human beings problems flaws hard imagine actor besides jean servais role tony le stéphanois members crew talking going money finally get tony answer expression face says minute heist sequence famous part movieand rightfully sothe film actually gets better afterwardthe director jules dassin knew decided music heist scene final shootout instead inserted great climactic score tonys final ride towards destiny think dassin american director blacklisted hollywood forced work france masterpiece cinema would never made way certainly wouldnt good made american film time absolutely horrible dassin go achieve greatest work benefit us im cringing thought upcoming al pacino remake heist films since rififi already borrowed way another theres reason remake masterpiece money leave classics alone soul calibur always favorite fighting game series time sciii favorite one seriesthe graphics well done much bigger improvement

dead sisters much older boyfriend christopher eccleston still mostly good grade b duck_of_death needs watch film major criticism completely baseless film never forgot time delay mentioned explicitly couple places crew never shown conversations mission control didnt obey time delay rulesone thing think bit farfetched amount risk involved would crew land planet pressure suits would last two hours doubt would manned space ship go stars corona doubt would humans land moon bombarded huge amounts radiation doubt also ship seemed overly sturdy would ship designed like risk atmospheric flight slow doubt would survive hit comet debris doubt think cases stresses structure would much allinall unlikely scenarios compensated nicely done special effects good editing production good acting especially actors portraying ships commander russian cosmonaut dont remember film getting cinema release saw came onto cable film deals dehumanisation children killing machines specifically one person way gets

however image demons devils dancing depths hell occurs beginning movie downright creepy although snippets part documentary hinting necessity recreational drug law reform welldeveloped contrast many snippets feel drugs happen currently illegal scourge imaginable solution incarceration even guilty even mere possession drugsalthough program whole leaves viewer impression drug war largely futile exercise waste money deserves praise almost nothing documentary addresses real problems total war merely possess illegal drugs obviously causes contributes tovery real problems drug warriors would tell asked think drug war designed solve example many minutes spent surge violence associated rising popularity crack cocaine point program even hint laws designed suppress crack cocaine make impossible drug sellers enforce contracts business arrangements courts law forcing resort violence stay business instead seeing laws important cause violence drugs seem take brunt blame inexplicably alcohol prohibition violence ensued subsequent reversal prohibition totally ignored programthis program help perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes drug users primary force driving expensive problematic drug war possibility incorporating drugs alcohol happy successful life really touched use drug excess probably going cause personal problems users drugs excess like alcohol users alcoholicsif want point view someone believes adults moral right incarcerated lives ruined criminal justice system using drugs government mostly arbitrary political reasons rather reasons based sound social policy legitimate science decided totally prohibit whose users decided notsometaphorically wage war forget none hereon hand hardly category antidrug propaganda mostly interesting neutrallypresented history drugs th century united states like marijuana lsd heroin cocaine mdma oxycontin significant element various peoples points view regard drug laws thoughtful wellinformed slanted favor drug warrior mentality especially respect drugs marijuana criminal justice system along often harsh liferuining penalties obviously answer appropriate answer every single social problem unfortunately theres epidemic nation asyet unnamed disease whose primary symptoms lack imagination respect social policy comes certain drugs lack compassion fellow humans prejudice people use drugs governmentallyapproved perhaps vested interest growth prisonpolicing industry horrid apathy regard human dignity morally wrong kidnap incarcerate people unless damn good reason mere possession arbitrarily selected group drugs clearly reason really primary issue comes drugs yet program ignores itso sum parts program neutrally present history without feeding stereotypes drug users heart drug war mentality pretty good interesting entertaining comes presenting rational nonradical point view regard drug policy giving viewer examples people drug problems also many people successfully incorporate drugs happy successful

julian sandss questionable performance could begin save already sunken barge movieit rates fromthe fiend twenty minutes movie already bored quite simply characters fairly dull occasionally something enjoyable would happen things would slow fortunately patience eventually rewarded ending movie wasnt bad however means good enough justify sitting first ninety minutes would say movie mediocre overall considering talent cast id call disappointment self proclaimed talented artist directed easily worst spanish film st century lack emotion coherence rhythm skills humor repeats situation shows character development even show violent andor sexual content add anything new psychokiller sub genre lame shown film schools example first moviebtw hell talent scenes shot almost identically scenes two master shots quite awful see action jumping one master shot another without reason camera almost never moves talented artist afraid showing lack visual skills actors playing main roles act like amateurs supporting cast hardly believable holes plot script ever onea really disheartening movie whatsoever talented director plot melissa new girl town shes fifteen years old birthday coming one week since melissa beautiful every boy town wants hook manage catch interest mysteriously dieto honest real reason wanted watch film dana kimmel friday th pt isnt proper reason rush see movie started watching realized sweet sixteen isnt good slasher really dull boring doesnt go anywhere hour three murders occurred story hasnt really developed possible waythe movie nicely shot quite nice photography good directing many slasher flicks movie suffers dark times acting actually pretty good though melissas character easy sympathize even though shes complete slutthe story line isnt completely rubbish way dull keep interested things kept interested melissa stunning dana kimmel whose really sweet cute movieall pretty dull slasher flick doesnt go anywhere id definitely wouldnt recommend slasher fans film funny film violence bad acting iswell dani stick singing screaming whatever hell usually random chicks wearing hardly anything catch sexuallyfrustrated goth lads personally think movie really suck story characters could good say directing actors little nibby things made better film bad reason people like piece crap danni film possibly worst brate film ever believe thats

one somewhat imaginative final one plain brutal sitting two weak comedic shorts third one truly painful watch even low standards national lampoon movie one seemed especially boring joyless wasted effort surface typical disaster movie involved lives people get caught big event however script awful theres much explaining characters background within dialogue feel treated like morons even sesame street didnt explain origins mr snuffleupagus mr hooper died work someone thought entering enron script would give currency discussing power companies acting large bland exception older performers randy quaid brian dennehy first hour couldnt care less storms took outbut maybe special effects watch sadly even yearold tv set could see one tractor trailer computergeneratedbadly maybe budgetary limitations forgive one footage plane trying land looked pretty real kept telling seen site confirms earlier film nowhere landso summary good bits another film see best action sequences compressed

       "\"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\""
